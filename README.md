• GED completion

PHASE 2 – CS + ML Core (2026 → 2027)
• Data Structures & Algorithms
• Classical Machine Learning
• Statistics for ML
• Linux + tooling mastery

PHASE 3 – AI Specialization (2027 → 2028)
• Deep Learning
• NLP (Multilingual, VN‑focused)
• Computer Vision

PHASE 4 – Systems + AI Integration (2028+)
• AI systems architecture
• Efficient inference & deployment
• Research / OSS contribution
